# VLDMoRt_OptExpress
This repository is underlying the results in the VLDMoRt paper published on Optical Express.

It includes the optimized N-1 design in Lumerical (FDTD), Matlab codes that analyze far-field, eta2 (Fig.2) and electric field at h/2.

The full optimized FDTD files are very big, hereby we decided not to push here. If there is any comments or questions about this part, please contact sophiayd@mit.edu
